            <img src="./images/ananthapura-lake-temple_.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="...">
            <p>Ananthapura Lake Temple is a serene Hindu temple built in the middle of a lake located in Village Ananthapura, Kasargod. It is a holy temple of Ananthapadmanabhan Swami. It is believed that Ananthapadmanabhan settled down here first and then moved to Thiruvananthapuram through a cave which lies to the right-hand side corner of the lake. The cave is said to be a natural structure that separates Ananthapura and Thiruvananthapuram and therefore, these two temples retain the name of the same deity.</p>
